There is a built-in Pomodoro timer in Windows 11. You can click the Play "Focus" to have a timer of 5 minutes intervals (5, 10, 15, 20, 25...). Once it gets above 30 minutes, the timer goes up by 15min with a maximum of 240 minutes.

Using the application window, you get 5 minutes interval that goes up to 50 minutes. Then starting at 65 minutes, the next interval is 15 minutes up to 230 minutes with a maximum of 240 minutes, which means the last interval is 10 minutes. If you start from 240 minutes and go down, the interval would go back to 15 minutes, giving you different sets of times, 225 minutes until 45 minutes, where the 5-minute interval starts again.

It will also automatically give you breaks in between long sessions. Below is the break table given the amount of focus time needed.

|Focus Times (in Minutes)|Number of Breaks|
|-|-|
|30|1|
|80|2|
|110|3|
|125|4|
|155|5|
|185|6|
|200|7|
|230|8|
